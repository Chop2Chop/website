			<h1>About this website</h1>
			<p>
				The purpose of this website is to have a single easily accessible location for my various projects, while simultaniously being one of these projects itself.
				I like doing little projects like these because they allow me to put some technical knowledge to use while also being an creative outlet.
				Furthermore the experienence they provide may prove invaluable.
